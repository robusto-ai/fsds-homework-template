# Exercise 1: Implement Bagging Aggregation

# Task: Write a Python function bagging_aggregation that takes a list of predictions from multiple models for a classification task and outputs the final aggregated prediction using majority voting.
#
# - Input: A list of lists, where each inner list contains predictions from a single model.
#
# - Output: A list of final predictions (aggregated using majority voting).
#
# Example:
#
# ```python
# predictions = [[1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1]] # predictions from 5 models for 3 samples
# output = [0, 0, 1]
# ```

def bagging_aggregation(predictions):
    """
    Perform bagging aggregation on the given predictions.
    
    Args:
        predictions (list of list): The predictions from multiple models.
    
    Returns:
        list: The aggregated predictions.

# Exercise 2: Boosting Weight Update

# Task: Write a Python function update_weights that updates weights for a boosting algorithm. Given a list of current weights, a list of binary predictions, and the actual labels, the function adjusts the weights by increasing the weight of misclassified samples.
#
# - Input: A list of current weights, a list of predictions, and a list of true labels.
#
# - Output: A list of updated weights.
#
# Example:
#
# ```python
# # Input: 
# weights=[0.2, 0.3, 0.5]
# predictions=[1, 0, 1]
# labels=[1, 1, 0]
#
# # Output: 
# output = [0.2, 0.6, 1.0]  # (weights are normalized)
# ```

def update_weights(weights, predictions, labels):
    """
    Update weights for a boosting algorithm.
    
    Args:
        weights (list): The current weights.
        predictions (list): The binary predictions.
        labels (list): The true labels.
    
    Returns:
        list: The updated weights.

# Exercise 3: Stacking Meta-Model Predictions

# Task: Write a Python function stacking_predictions that takes the predictions of multiple models (as a 2D list) and a meta-model (as a callable function) to predict the final output.
#
# - Input: A 2D list of predictions (where each row is from a model) and a callable meta-model (e.g., a lambda function).
#
# - Output: A list of final predictions from the meta-model.
#
# Example:
#
# ```python
# # Input: 
# predictions=[[0.8, 0.1], [0.6, 0.4], [0.7, 0.2]]
# meta_model=lambda x: 1 if sum(x)/len(x) > 0.5 else 0
#
# # Output: 
# output = [1, 0]
# ```

    Args:
        predictions (list of list): The predictions from multiple models.
        meta_model (function): The meta model to combine predictions.
    
    Returns:
        list: The final predictions.
